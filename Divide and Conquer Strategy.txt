Divide and Conquer Haskell exercises

This gives me the most amount of anxiety but if I just do 20 minutes at a time, up to an hour, it will get done.
Breaking it down into things that will take me an hour (or more). First starting with what needs to be broken up.

Goal: To understand the TTF paper and learn how to do some honest to goodness metaprogramming. 

-try writing digital Haskell notes so it goes faster

Broken down sections
- Understand his TTF code (tried even running it for example programs given and ran into an error)
	- Understand TTF concepts
		- Going though 1 section at a time to read/do the Typed Tagless Final Interpreters paper by Oleg Kiselyov
			- 
	- Understand Haskell Concepts
		Keywords to learn/refresh 1 hr each:
			class
			newtype
			instance
			data
			records/record syntax (making record syntax for stuff (like class paramaters), don't have to specify in order)
				Can make all EPTA objects using record syntax
			modules
			maybe


Unbroken down sections:
- Understand his TTF code (tried even running it for example programs given and ran into an error)
	- Understand Haskell Concepts
		Keywords to learn/refresh:
			class
			newtype
			instance
			data
			records/record syntax
			modules
	
- Understand what exercises 2 is trying to do
	- Understand MP concepts
- Doing each of the 5 exercises
