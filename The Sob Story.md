I was working on (and very concerned about passing) a discrete math final assignment and the final exam.
Alongside this, I was very behind (more mentally than in reality) on these assignments over the entire semester. 
I learned and read a good bit about Haskell but never really implemented those learnings.
I often procrastinate work that I think is going to be very hard, I’m behind on, and I don’t want to do. 
It’s kind of an avoidance pattern brought on by stress and this behaviour is often why I don’t do well academically once I inevitably fall behind then feel too guilty to catch back up (or ask for help).
This behaviour is something I’ve tried to work on (partially through therapy and mindfulness) to varying degrees throughout my (very young) academic career. 
I know I’ll never be perfect but it’s something I constantly want to strive to be better at during graduate school.

So in essence I was in full avoidance mode with the assignment the entire time and thought I could catch up but this wasn’t very realistic.
